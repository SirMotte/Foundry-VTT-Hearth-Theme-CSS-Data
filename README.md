Attention: Raw WIP!

# Sir Motte's Magnificent Darkness - Heart Theme for Foundry VTT
This is my attempt at a recreation of my [Theme for Fantasy Grounds](https://github.com/SirMotte/FGU-Theme-Hearth) that was well received.
Right now this is for my personal use only and raw work in progress, if you already want to test ist and get a feel on how it looks, feel free to follow the set-up instructions below and report back with findings and opinions.

## Requirements:
[DnD 5E Ruleset]
[Ernie's Modern UI](xxx) (Mandatory)
[Custom CSS](xxx) (Mandatory)
[Tidy5ESheet] (Recommended)

## Supported Modules 
(Others work out of the box or are not used by me. Right now I won't take requests for additional module support):

[Action Pack](https://github.com/teroparvinen/foundry-action-pack)
[Always HP](https://github.com/ironmonk88/always-hp)
[Anonymous](https://github.com/reonZ/anonymous)
[Damage Log](https://github.com/cs96and/FoundryVTT-damage-log)
[Dice Tray](https://gitlab.com/asacolips-projects/foundry-mods/foundry-vtt-dice-calculator)
[Monk's Common Display](https://github.com/ironmonk88/monks-common-display)
[Monk's Token Bar](https://github.com/ironmonk88/monks-tokenbar)
[Small Weather](https://github.com/LeafWulf/smallweather)

## Known Issues:
- Some areas of certain UI elements are hard to read or messed up. This is mostly caused by Ernie's Modern UI and me not having touched these areas yet.

[Combat Tracker Disposition](https://github.com/LebombJames/combat-tracker-disposition) - slight bugs with icons, investigating
[Ready Set Roll for D&D5e](https://github.com/MangoFVTT/fvtt-ready-set-roll-5e) - Currently Ernie's UI breaks the buttons on Chat cards. He said he will add support in the future.
[Token Variant Art](https://github.com/Aedif/TokenVariants) - Ernie's UI currently makes the Token HUD UI hard to use. No ETA on a fix.

##Set-UP

In oder to make this work you need to apply the following settings to Ernie's Modern UI:
