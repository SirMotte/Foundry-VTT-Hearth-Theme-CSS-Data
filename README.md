This is a recreation of my well received [Theme for Fantasy Grounds Unity](https://github.com/SirMotte/FGU-Theme-Hearth).
Follow the set-up instructions below and ideally report back with findings and opinions.

## Requirements:
- Foundry VTT (Duh!)
- DnD 5E Ruleset (No support for other rulesets is planned)
- [Ernie's Modern UI](https://github.com/ernieayala/ernies-modern-layout) (Required, make sure to use the Pre-Release Version linked in Ernie's Readme.)
- [Custom CSS Module](https://github.com/cswendrowski/FoundryVTT-Custom-CSS) (Required)
- [Tidy5ESheet](https://github.com/sdenec/tidy5e-sheet) (Highly Recommended, must be set to Dark Ui for best results)
- Calibri Font Installed - Guide in the Works (Recommended - Some UI elements will be quirky with other font styles)

## Installation Instructions and Set-Up

1. Install the required modules to Foundy VTT.
2. Navigate to the module settings for the Custom CSS Module and open the "Custom CSS Rules" window. Copy-Paste all entries found in the "Custom CSS Module Settings.css" and hit save. You can choose to apply the style on a global basis or as User Style. Please refere to the Custom CSS Module Documentation for further information.
3. Download the Sir_Motte_Hearth_Foundry.json from this repository.
   - Open Ernie's Modern UI Settings and open the settings menu:

   - Navigate to the Options Tab and Press "Import Theme".

   - Choose the downloaded Sir_Motte_Hearth_Foundry.json file and import it.
4. (Only if used) Open up the Tidy5e Sheet Settings and set it to the "Alternative (dark)" color scheme. Additional Settings used need further testing in regard of UI Elements. I will update this document accordingly.
5. Install the Calibri Font for use in Foundry VTT. To match my setup do as follows:
   - coming soon

This should be it. Happy testing and bug hunting. Please report any findings to me either on Discord (Sir Motte#1305) or use the GitHub issue reporter.

## Known Issues:
- Modules that alter UI elements can potentially cause UI issues.
- It's impossible for me to test all modules. If you come across readbility issues, contact me.
- [Module Management +](https://github.com/mouse0270/module-credits): Export Window is barely readable. Can't figure out how to fix this (<-CSS Noob)


Have Fun!
Sir Motte
